The strace command is tracing the syscalls that are made by that command
For example when I ran strace on curl that I made to google.com

It displayed all the syscalls in order to fetch the data from server 
ex: execc() call, receive() call etc are made.



Notes:
strace intercepts syscalls between a process and the Linux kernel.
It lets you see exactly what a process is doing behind the scenes â€” from opening files to connecting to networks to sleeping and dying.
